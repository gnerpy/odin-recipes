    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This creamy, gooey macaroni and cheese recipe, inspired by cacio e pepe, boasts only three staple ingredients and
        comes together in about 10 minutes, making it quicker and simpler than boxed versions. The technique involves
        cooking pasta in a small amount of water to create a starchy base that emulsifies with cheddar, resulting in a
        perfectly smooth and cheesy sauce, after some initial troubleshooting to prevent greasiness.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 ounces (170 g) elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
        <li>6 ounces (180 ml) evaporated milk</li>
        <li>6 ounces (170 g) grated mild or medium cheddar cheese, or any good melting cheese, such as Fontina, Gruyère,
            or Jack</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place macaroni in a medium saucepan, add just enough cold water to cover, and a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring frequently.</li>
        <li>Continue to cook, stirring, until water is almost absorbed and macaroni is just shy of al dente (about 6
            minutes).</li>
        <li>Immediately add evaporated milk and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add cheese, reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring continuously, until cheese is melted and a creamy sauce
            forms (about 2 minutes).</li>
        <li>Season with more salt to taste and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
