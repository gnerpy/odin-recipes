    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Made with 4 ingredients — flour, water, salt, and yeast — this simple, no-knead pizza dough recipe can be ready
        start to finish in 3 hours. It produces a pizza with a ballooned edge and crisp but pliable crust. You can use
        the dough the same day you mix it or store it in the fridge for up to 5 days (or freeze it!).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups (512 g) bread flour or all-purpose flour, plus more for assembly</li>
        <li>3 to 4 teaspoons (10 to 15 g) kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon (4 g) instant yeast</li>
        <li>1.75 to 2 cups (400 to 454 g) lukewarm water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and instant yeast. Add the water and, using a rubber
            spatula, mix until the water is absorbed and the ingredients form a sticky dough ball.</li>
        <li>Pour a drop or two of oil over the top and rub with your hands to coat. Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel
            or plastic wrap and set aside in a warm spot to rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until the dough has doubled in
            bulk.</li>
        <li><em>Optional:</em> If time permits, 30 minutes after covering the bowl, perform one set of stretches and
            folds (stretch the dough up and in 8 to 10 times) to strengthen the dough.</li>
        <li>Place a Baking Steel or pizza stone in the top third of the oven and preheat to its hottest setting (550°F).
            Ensure the steel heats for at least 45 minutes once the oven reaches temperature.</li>
        <li>Liberally flour a work surface and turn the dough out. Use a bench scraper to divide the dough into 4 equal
            portions. With floured hands, roll each portion into a ball by pinching the dough underneath.</li>
        <li><strong>Proof the dough:</strong> If baking immediately, let the balls sit on their tucked-in edges for 30
            to 60 minutes in a lidded, lightly floured vessel. If using refrigerated dough, remove it from the fridge 60
            to 90 minutes before baking to proof.</li>
        <li>Handling the dough minimally, shape it into a 10″–12″ round using the backs of your hands.</li>
        <li>Lay a sheet of parchment paper on a pizza peel (optionally using a few drops of oil on the paper) and
            transfer the dough round to the peel.</li>
        <li><strong>Top the pizza:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><em>For Margherita:</em> Spread 2 oz tomato sauce, 3 oz mozzarella, drizzle with olive oil, and add
                    a pinch of flaky sea salt.</li>
                <li><em>For Kale & Crème Fraîche:</em> Spread 1–2 tbsp crème fraîche, sprinkle with garlic and grated
                    Parmigiano Reggiano, and top with kale (tossed in olive oil and salt).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Shimmy the pizza (parchment and all) into the oven and bake for about 5 minutes until the top is blistered.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer to a cutting board, discard the parchment paper, garnish with basil (if making Margherita), cut,
            and serve.</li>
    </ol>
