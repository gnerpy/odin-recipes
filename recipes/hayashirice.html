    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hayashi Rice, or hashed beef, is a rich Western-style stew of thin-sliced beef and mushrooms in a velvety
        demi-glace sauce. Served with steamed rice, this uniquely Japanese creation is a home-cooking staple and popular
        comfort food for all ages!</p>
    <p>One of my son’s favorite Japanese food is hayashi rice (ハヤシライス). He has such passion for the stew that he can
        talk about how much he loves the tender beef and the delicious demi-glace sauce in great animation. It can be
        entertaining to watch a kid talk about food sometimes. There is so much excitement, and it warms my heart
        knowing that all the hours spent in the kitchen is greatly appreciated. I digress a little, but let’s get back
        to hayashi rice, a family staple and a comfort dish for all ages in Japan.</p>
